# Stripes CLI Troubleshooting

This page contains troubleshooting suggestions and known issues for the CLI.  Refer to [stripes-core's troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core/blob/master/doc/troubleshooting.md) for general Stripes troubleshooting.

Also refer to the [STCLI project](https://issues.folio.org/browse/STCLI) in the [FOLIO issue tracker](https://dev.folio.org/guidelines/issue-tracker) to review open bugs that may contain relevant notes or workarounds.


## My new Stripes UI app does not show up!

When a newly created app does not show up in the navigation bar, this is likely due to the user not having permission to view the app.  In order to have permission to view the app:
  1. The app's module descriptor must be posted to Okapi
  2. The module must be associated with a tenant
  3. The user must be assigned the app's permission `module.[appName].enabled`

Given you are already [logged into Okapi](./commands.md#okapi-login-command), check to see if the user has permissions to your app.  For example:
```
stripes perm view --user diku_admin
```

See [assigning permissions](./user-guide.md#assigning-permissions) if you need to add the module descriptor to Okapi, assign the module to a tenant, or assign module permissions to a user.


## Global install on Windows with Yarn >=1.5.1

**Note:** An initial fix for this issue has been included with CI builds starting with `1.1.100071` on `npm-folioci` and will be released with version `1.2.0` on the regular `npm-folio` registry.  If you still experience trouble, please report your issue and try the original solution below.

Yarn's global install directory changed on Windows with the release of Yarn 1.5.1.  A dependent package used to retrieve the global installation has not been updated to reflect this change.  This causes an issue in which the CLI is unable to locate `stripes-core`.

The problem will surface at build time as a few "Module not found" errors such as the following:
```
ERROR in multi webpack-hot-middleware/client typeface-source-sans-pro @folio/stripes-components/lib/global.css C:/Users/mattjones/AppData/Local/Yarn/Data/global/node_modules/@folio/stripes-core/src/index
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'babel-loader' in 'C:\Users\mattjones\projects\folio\ui-users'
```

The interim solution is to include `stripes-core` locally in your platform's dependencies, or in the case of an app, create an alias to clone of stripes-core.

Install stripes-core:
```
git clone https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core.git
cd stripes-core
yarn install
```

Create an alias:
```
stripes alias add @folio/stripes-core ..path/to/stripes-core
```

Alternatively, update your `.stripesclirc` configuration:
```
{
  "aliases": {
    "@folio/stripes-core": "..path/to/stripes-core"
  }
}
```
